# Monochrome_Facial_Recognition_PCA
The purpose of this project is to create a facial recognition application in monochrome images using PCA. The main idea in this application is widely known as the 'eigenfaces'.
ORL Dataset has been used.
The ORL dataset, consisting of 400 grayscale images of 40 individuals, is used for facial recognition by applying the Eigenfaces method with PCA. Each image is flattened into a vector, and the mean image is subtracted to normalize the data. PCA is performed on the covariance matrix of these vectors to extract principal components, where the top eigenvectors represent the Eigenfaces. During this process, images are projected onto the Eigenface space to generate feature vectors, which are stored as representations of known faces. For recognition, new images are similarly projected in the previously defined subspace and matched to stored vectors using a similarity metric like Euclidean distance. The highes similarity score gives the appropiate recognized image (person). The entire code is written in Matlab.
